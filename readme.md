# README / Contributing / License

To talk about cloud native applications and systems, we need to define cloud native. CNCF provides a high-level overview of what it means to be cloud native and lists some implementations and the benefits they provide in the [CNCF Cloud Native Definition v1.0](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md).

The [cloud native principles](https://github.com/cloud-native-principles/cloud-native-principles) seek to clarify further the underlying fundamental concepts of what it means to be cloud native.

NOTE: This is a work in progress.

## Fundamental Concepts

* Service discovery
* Loose coupling
* Microservices
* Low overhead/coarse-grained packaging 
  * examples: containers, unikernel
* Declarative consumption model
  * includes APIs and configuration
  * applies to all layers: infra, workloads, platform, and components
* Designed for automation
  * applies to testing, deployment, application and platform autoscaling, infra and network provisioning
* Immutable infrastructure 

Each of these concepts is covered in more depth in [cloud-native-principles.md](https://github.com/cloud-native-principles/cloud-native-principles/blob/master/cloud-native-principles.md).

When these principles are implemented, they lead to benefits such as:

* Increased interoperability
* Increased resilience
* Increased scalability
* Lowered risk

Defining these concepts help in applying cloud native methodologies to different technology domains. For instance, in the networking and communication service provider spaces, the [Cloud Native Networking papers](cloud-native-networking-preamble.md) illustrate this.

**CONTRIBUTING**

We encourage civil discourse and debate about the principles. It's not only acceptable but desirable for the points to be discussed and adapted to where the community as a whole feels we are. In other words, it is ok to disagree with a principle and propose an alternative.

How to contribute:

* [Add ideas and comments to existing issues](https://github.com/cloud-native-principles/cloud-native-principles/issues)
* [create a new issue](https://github.com/cloud-native-principles/cloud-native-principles/issues/new)
* Make changes to documents by:
  * [fork the repo](https://github.com/cloud-native-principles/cloud-native-principles/fork)
  * make your change in your fork \(+branch\)
  * [create a PR](https://github.com/cloud-native-principles/cloud-native-principles/pulls)
